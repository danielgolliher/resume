## üíº Work Experience

### **Sabbatical Break - Independent Projects** | _July 2020‚Äîpresent_

For the past 16 months I‚Äôve pursued several independent projects:

* [Maximum New York](https://maximumnewyork.com/): a civics project to help increase housing stock in New York City. I built the site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/); site hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and source hosting by [GitHub](https://github.com/danielgolliher) (private repo). 
* [Graph of the New York City charter](https://golliher.substack.com/p/understanding-nycs-government): I built a graph of the NYC charter (~540 pages) to gain a better understanding of the interrelationships between different parts of the city government. I uploaded the charter to [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and manually tagged it with my own taxonomy. See the graph [here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/NYC_govt/graph).  
* [Jack & Percy Publishing](https://jackandpercypublishing.com/): a small independent publishing venture; I redesign classic books for better aesthetics and physical feel, from start to finish. I estimate that I‚Äôll do about two books a year (the second is in process). I have also previously written and independently produced [three other books](https://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Golliher/e/B00MW9N79I). 
* [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/): I‚Äôve hosted six salons as an Interintellect host on a variety of topics, and I worked with another ii team member to set up the company‚Äôs current website (we migrated from Wix to Wordpress, and I built out payment and membership functionality). I will be hosting two salons in November 2021. 

### **Senior Public Relations Specialist - Rankings & Awards** @ [Ropes & Gray](https://ropesgray.com) | _May 2018‚ÄîJuly 2020_

Review from my manager ([here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgolliher/) on LinkedIn):
> Daniel is an exceptional team member: smart, diligent, results-oriented and fun to boot. He absorbs complex information quickly, mapping out plans and strategies to get results. Case in point, he led our firm's rankings & awards program, entering the role with limited familiarity with rankings, and over several years, he increased the firm's prestige, if not maintained it. He gets the big picture, and all the nitty gritty details. Not to mention he's a terrific human and a great teammate - with an even keel ‚Äî and an attitude to help others.

* **Worked directly with dozens of partners throughout the firm to craft their rankings and awards strategy, which included: interview prep and follow-up, data analysis and presentation, writing award submissions detailing their work, and tracking their flow of business to continually update the firm's PR strategy. For the first year of this position I focused exclusively on the firm‚Äôs litigation and enforcement practice, including competition law.** 
* Highlighted the success of attorneys while making sure: (1) submissions were aligned with the business strategies of the practice, (2) submissions strictly followed client preferences and confidentiality/ethical considerations. This resulted in: continued year-over-year growth in ranking recognitions, with a high of 20% annual increase in one publication (unprecedented prior to my employment). 
* Alerted partners to the various pending submission deadlines and kept them on task over project time horizons that spanned months. This also required securing extensions from ranking publications when partners were extremely busy, and I regularly negotiated as much as a month of extra time while still maintaining good relationships with the publications‚Äîwithout interfering with our submissions‚Äô success. 
* Trained other individuals in PR and business development on how to write and research ranking submissions.
* Wrote posts for the firm's website highlighting rankings and awards won, and reports for firm leadership.
* Note: this position was new to the firm when I accepted it, so I developed the role as I worked. See my LinkedIn for even further detail.

### **Harvard College Outreach & Marketing Coordinator** @ [Harvard Recreation](https://recreation.gocrimson.com) | _Jan 2017‚ÄîMay 2018_

* Created a unified marketing program for Harvard Recreation, comprising a successful teaser campaign in Spring 2017 and a full program in the 2017/8 year. This won coverage in the school paper (irregular for university administrative programs), and provoked a 15% increase in gym attendance among undergraduates. 
* Conceived and executed a marketing event that gathered data from 25% of all Harvard College students, which I used to inform further program plans.
* Created new revenue streams and plans to optimize existing ones; I created ~$20k in new revenue in Fall 2017 with test marketing plan implementations.
* Planned and oversaw over 20 new outreach events during the Fall 2017 semester, and over 30 in Spring 2018.
* Revised Harvard Recreation‚Äôs website from its previous state of inactivity; integrated and managed Google Analytics to draw usable data from web traffic.
* Developed new standards and practices for Harvard Recreation marketing in graphic design, student communication, and departmental strategy. All are steeped in an awareness of ‚Äúcargo cult marketing/communications,‚Äù adapted from Feynman‚Äôs ‚Äúcargo cult science.‚Äù
* **See [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgolliher/) for my ~4.5 years of work with Harvard Recreation during my undergraduate years, as a manager on duty of two athletic facilities. 

### **Sabbatical - Independent Projects (in Cincinnati, OH)** | _April 2016‚ÄîJan 2017_

* Worked as regular opening and closing staff at Coffee Emporium, one of Ohio‚Äôs top-ranked coffee shops.
* Independently published [my third book](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Wayne-County-Daniel-Golliher/dp/1539678571/)

### **Corporate Paralegal** @ [Ropes & Gray](https://ropesgray.com) | _April 2015‚ÄîApril 2016_

* I joined Ropes & Gray‚Äôs first class of ‚Äúprogram paralegals,‚Äù who work at the firm to learn about legal practice and prepare for law school, with the intention that they return to the firm. I did later return to the firm, but not as a lawyer.
* During this time I also wrote and independently published [my second book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/197624708X/).
* See LinkedIn for deeper detail on the transactional work I performed.
