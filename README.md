## üíº Work Experience

### **Sabbatical** | _July 2020->present_

For the past 16 months I‚Äôve pursued several independent projects:

* [Maximum New York](https://maximumnewyork.com/): a civics project to help increase housing stock in New York City. One early component of this project is the NYC charter map (below). I built the site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/); site hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and source hosting by [GitHub](https://github.com/danielgolliher) (private repo). 
* [Graph of the New York City charter](https://golliher.substack.com/p/understanding-nycs-government): I built a graph of the NYC charter (~560 pages) to gain a better understanding of the interrelationships between different parts of the city government. I uploaded the charter to [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and manually tagged it with my own taxonomy. See the graph [here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/NYC_govt/graph).  
* [Jack & Percy Publishing](https://jackandpercypublishing.com/): a small independent publishing venture; I redesign classic books for better aesthetics and physical feel. I estimate that I‚Äôll do about two books a year (the second is in process). 
* [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/): I‚Äôve hosted six salons as an Interintellect host on a variety of topics, and I worked with another ii team member to set up the company‚Äôs current website (we migrated from Wix to Wordpress, and I built out payment and membership functionality). I will be hosting two salons in November 2021. 

### **Senior Public Relations Specialist - Rankings & Awards** @ [Ropes & Gray](https://ropesgray.com) | _May 2018->July 2020_

Review from my manager ([here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgolliher/) on LinkedIn):
> Daniel is an exceptional team member: smart, diligent, results-oriented and fun to boot. He absorbs complex information quickly, mapping out plans and strategies to get results. Case in point, he led our firm's rankings & awards program, entering the role with limited familiarity with rankings, and over several years, he increased the firm's prestige, if not maintained it. He gets the big picture, and all the nitty gritty details. Not to mention he's a terrific human and a great teammate - with an even keel ‚Äî and an attitude to help others.

* **Worked directly with dozens of partners throughout the firm to craft their rankings and awards strategy, which included: interview prep and follow-up, data analysis and presentation, writing award submissions detailing their work, and tracking their flow of business to continually update the firm's PR strategy.** 
* Wrote 4-7 research submissions per month for various legal ranking directories including Chambers and The Legal 500, among others (see [here](https://chambers.com/info/submissions) for a representative submission template). This required functional and object-level knowledge of tens of practice groups across the firm. 
* Highlighted the success of attorneys while making sure: (1) submissions were aligned with the business strategies of the practice, (2) submissions strictly followed client preferences and confidentiality/ethical considerations.
* Gathered and collated client referrals for rankings and submissions firmwide; I created a database in Excel using pivot tables and a data model to track the hundreds of references we used per year, to ensure that referees were not overused in accordance with both their and various publications‚Äô preferences. 
* Managed a calendar of ranking publications, directories, surveys and awards. 
* Alerted partners to the various pending submission deadlines and kept them on task over project time horizons that spanned months.
* Prepared partners for interviews with ranking publications. The interviews covered the legal market, Ropes & Gray‚Äôs practice, and the individual partner‚Äôs practice.
* Trained other individuals in PR and business development on how to write and research ranking submissions.
* _Note_: this position was new to the firm when I accepted it, so I developed the role as I worked. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgolliher/) for even further detail. 

### **Harvard College Outreach & Marketing Coordinator** @ [Harvard Recreation](https://recreation.gocrimson.com) | _Jan 2017->May 2018_

* Created a unified marketing program for Harvard Recreation, comprising a successful teaser campaign in Spring 2017 and a full program in the 2017/8 year.
* Conceived and executed a marketing event that gathered data from 25% of all Harvard College students, which I used to inform further program plans.
* Planned and oversaw over 20 new outreach events during the Fall 2017 semester, and over 30 in Spring 2018.
* Revised Harvard Recreation‚Äôs website from its previous state of inactivity; integrated and managed Google Analytics to draw usable data from web traffic.
* Developed new standards and practices for Harvard Recreation marketing in graphic design, student communication, and departmental strategy. All are steeped in an awareness of ‚Äúcargo cult marketing/communications,‚Äù adapted from Feynman‚Äôs ‚Äúcargo cult science.‚Äù
* Created new revenue streams and plans to optimize existing ones; I created ~$20k in new revenue in Fall 2017 with test marketing plan implementations.
* **See [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgolliher/) for my ~4.5 years of work with Harvard Recreation during my undergraduate years, as a manager on duty of two athletic facilities. 

### **Sabbatical (in Cincinnati, OH)** | _April 2016->Jan 2017_

* Worked as staff at Coffee Emporium, a popular coffee shop (see LinkedIn)
* Independently published [my third book](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Wayne-County-Daniel-Golliher/dp/1539678571/)

### **Corporate Paralegal** @ [Ropes & Gray](https://ropesgray.com) | _April 2015->April 2016_

* I joined Ropes & Gray‚Äôs first class of ‚Äúprogram paralegals,‚Äù who work at the firm to learn about legal practice and prepare for law school, with the intention that they return to the firm. I did later return to the firm, but not as a lawyer.
* During this time I also wrote and independently published [my second book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/197624708X/).
* See LinkedIn for deeper detail on the transactional work I performed.
